# Purpose/Inspiration

As an avid player of Old School Runescape, I often find myself looking through many youtube videos to see what monsters will make me the most money.
This was a frustrating thing to do when I knew that the player-driven economy was constantly fluctuating, and these videos could be completely wrong very quickly.
I started with a simple python script to figure out this info, but I moved to a webapp so that I could practice my skills and calculate income without the big ticket rare drops and determine how consistent monsters are with gross income.
